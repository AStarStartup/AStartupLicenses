# Kabuki Licenses

* [Kabuki Strong Source-available License](./LicenseSourceAvailableWeak.md) - An open-source license designed to protect your copyright rights, allows only the IP Owner to monetize, and forces users to donate back any improvements. It features a clause that allows for commercial use under a separate paid license from your website agreed upon before download, facilitating one-time donations, closed-source Software-as-a-Service, and avoiding app store fees. Use this license if you need to prevent others from selling your open-source products and books.
* [Kabuki Weak Source-available License](./LicenseSourceAvailableStrong.md) - An open-source license designed to provide the most protection to free-to-use projects from Open-source Theft from predatorial companies and individuals by granting free personal licenses with an instant termination clause for anyone engaging in Open-source theft. The license additionally allows those affected by the license restriction to purchase a license through a designated website. Use this license if you want the open-source to be used by end-users for commercial purposes without donating improvements.

This is the license generally recommended for products/businesses that do not sub-license their products.
