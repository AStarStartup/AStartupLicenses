# Kabuki Strong Source-available License

The Kabuki Strong Source-available License is an open-source license designed to protect your copyright rights, sole monetization by the IP Owner, and forces users to donate back any improvements. It features a clause that allows for commercial use under a separate paid license from your website agreed upon before download, facilitating one-time donations, closed-source Software-as-a-Service, and avoiding app store fees. Use this license if you need to prevent others from profiting from your open-source products and books without paying you.

This instructions for how to implement this license in your project can be found in the root [ReadMe.md](readme.md) file.
